# Perl - Test OpenTracing Interface

Testing Implementations


## SYNOPSIS

### Testing Interface Methods

```perl
use Test::OpenTracing::Interface::SpanContext;

can_all_ok( 'MyImplementation::SpanContext',
    "'MyImplementation' class implements required methods for 'SpanContext'";

```

### Testing Implementation Typechecks

```perl
use Test::OpenTracing::Interface::SpanContext;

my $test_object = MyImplementation::SpanContext->new();

interface_lives_ok( $test_object,
    "'MyImplementation' class is strict on typechecks for 'SpanContext'";

```


## DESCRIPTION

Test::OpenTracing is an easy way to check your OpenTracing compliant framework
integrations and implementations.

The `can_all_ok` test, basically run `can_ok` tests.

The `lives_ok` and `dies_ok` test run a series of test against each
(required) method, to see if they are fault tolerant or strict on accepting in
coming parameters and returned results.
